our end that would be changing in between these successes/failures (using the same api key, ip address, etc.) so I'm leaning towards external causes -&gt; i.e. I&rsquo;ve seen reports of increased issues (similar to this one) one since GCM was deprecated. A few people had success with regenerating the GCM keys, others did not.

at least with our view, we receive 'alarm by type' (Agency tab) data broken down into two categories; EMS or Other. If, in a format similar to the Group Paging, each agency could define the alarm types as sent by their dispatch agency, the data and pie chart would be of greater value. The graph could not only represent each individual call type as defined by the agency, but also a broader definition Example: EMS = MED, MEDX, BLS, BLSN. Fire = FR, FC, FB. etc. The user could select a pie chart and data listing based upon either the Grouping or drilled down to the actual call type.

When you get a call and you update your status (STA, SCENE, UNAVA, etc.) it will reflect your status. If another call comes in around the same time or shortly after and you update the status on that call, it then removes the status from your previous call. Allow it to maintain the status for each call so that we can see who is reponding to the first call and who is responding or on a delay to the second call. We have incidents where you are almost finish with one call and another call comes in. You can see who is on each call and who will be responding to the next call. Example: I'm on call 1 and call 2 comes in. I am finishing on call 1 and will be responding to call 2, so I mark my status as DELAY. The call 2 people can see who is on call 1 and also see who from call 1 is coming to call 2 (or vice-versa).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>[ Bryan ] Windows is the last client to get this.

The difference is that there is a pop up that says “confirm the move?” I think there should be the same pop up window so that the user realizes that they did a move.
