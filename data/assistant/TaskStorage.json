difficult to reproduce the exact circumstances:</p>\r\n<p>1) On rare occasion, the app will crash on the map because it tries to display a device that it does not have in it's database. &nbsp;This is most likely to occur if the app is just opened and the map is immediately opened, when it hasn't had a chance to parse its get_all_volatile data yet.</p>\r\n<p>2) The alert report was crashing on rare occasion, it looks like it could be when the app is backgrounded while on the report page and then reopened.</p>\r\n<p>3) The background location update would sometimes crash if the location update service is started before the app has a chance to fully initialize, which could be when the app is silently killed in the background due to resource constraints and then started up again by the OS when resources are again available for it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Android build available
