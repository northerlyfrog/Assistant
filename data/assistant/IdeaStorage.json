I am thinking this should be more of a selectable option for departments on a<br>cases by case basis that they can chose rather than something that is just automatically<br>integrated into everyone’s system.</p>","created_at":"2017-10-10T17:05:50.410Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911FEAT-I-380","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911FEAT-I-380","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6372619345979656355","name":"Jamie Suter","email":"jamie.suter@active911.com","created_at":"2017-01-06T22:17:44.079Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T16:44:30.667Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":4,"endorsements_count":1,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[{"key":"i_need_it","name":"I need it...","value":"Not Sure -- just thought it was cool","type":"string"},{"key":"platform","name":"Platform","value":["All Clients"],"type":"array"}]},{"id":"6400369555567076358","name":"Print from Web Console","reference_num":"PL-I-3554","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:43.243Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T21:33:50.859Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":33,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255416874675","name":"Likely to implement","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369555729921408","body":"<p>As an account administrator, I need a way to print the various information in the account from the tabs, like a report or list of devices, alerts, users, map data, etc.,</p>","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:43.282Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","duplicate_of":{"id":"6369572872786403417","reference_num":"A911-I-43","name":"Export of Groups/Devices/Users","created_at":"2016-12-29T17:15:51.768Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255416874675","name":"Likely to implement","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6369572872946264310","body":"<p>Giving the admin the ability to export their own data for Groups, Devices and Users.&nbsp;</p>","created_at":"2016-12-29T17:15:51.803Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911-I-43","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911-I-43"},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3554","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3554","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369120267008183","name":"Web view Alarm Tones","reference_num":"PL-I-2811","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:01.888Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T14:21:42.267Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":33,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369120560823459","body":"I would like to see if we can edit different tones for web view so a selected tone could be heard on the firehouse speaker.

Integration could also allow me to geofence, going on/off duty when I cross a threshold if I'm within a given distance of the district.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:32.942Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","duplicates":[{"id":"6403024063697653864","reference_num":"A911FEAT-I-145","name":"Alexa skill","created_at":"2017-03-29T20:43:34.076Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6403024064059068134","body":"<p>I am trying to get Alexa or IFTTT to trigger our Hue lights red if we get a call so its a visual cue if your running equipment or miss the audio.&nbsp;</p>","created_at":"2017-03-29T20:43:34.163Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911FEAT-I-145","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911FEAT-I-145"},{"id":"6400369271558207697","reference_num":"PL-I-3079","name":"If This Then Than (IFTTT) App Support","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:37.115Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369271685721397","body":"Support for the IFTTT app. This would allow users to set up automation of lighting etc. when combined with the active 911 app within the firehouse.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:37.149Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3079","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3079"},{"id":"6400369497044046646","reference_num":"PL-I-3466","name":"IFTTT Integration","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:29.615Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369497206181655","body":"Set up the ability for a user to configure a personal 'recipe' with Active911 alerts.

Pre-planning is an essential part of an effective response to emergency incidents. Currently, our department uses MDC's in all of our apparatus, but would like to transition to iPads utilizing the Active911 app because of its versatility and cost effectiveness. One feature that makes us hesitant to make that transition is the ability to edit pre-plans in the field. The way Active911 is set up now, our staff has to create a pre-plan image on the desktop, upload those files from our desktop to the Active911 account, then look up the longitude and latitude to make sure we get it in the right location. When we need to edit pre-plan information, we have to do this process all over again. This lacks the portability/availability and time-saving features that Active911 is known for. Idea: - Create a pre-plan tab for the app, a database of searchable pre-plan data for that particular account. - Give specific devices the authority to edit pre-plan data. - Allow devices to drop a point on a map, and create a pre-plan for that location. - Allow devices to enter pre-plan information into a form. This would contain basic information such as utility locations, hazards, contact information, construction type, occupancy classification, number of stories, square footage/fire flow, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, etc. - Ability to view pre-plans directly from the call sheet based on the address of the emergency. This would be a huge step forward for Active911, giving departments better capability to make their pre-plans readily available and, more importantly, keep them accurate. Thanks for all your company does for us and we hope to see this feature In-Progress soon!","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:55.982Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","duplicates":[{"id":"6433415516693124413","reference_num":"A911FEAT-I-248","name":"Pre-Plan Management and Viewing","created_at":"2017-06-19T18:17:55.641Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6433415516978318093","body":"<p>I would like to see the ability to do a pre-plan inside of Active911.

I think it would be better for it to continue to work for the duration of an incident.  For law enforcement, units conducting surveillance could maintain better situational awareness if they knew the location of every other unit on the detail.  Being able to see the locations of the other units on a map would be a great feature to have.  This would also apply to fire incidents.  For example, on a search and rescue incident in a forest, each member of the search team and the incident commander could see the position of each unit in real time.  Another potential benefit is one of enhanced responder safety.  Assume you run an EMS call in the winter, transport to nearest hospital, and then go available by radio, but then, on your way back to the station, you slide off the side of a mountain.  It would be nice if someone could find you once it was determined that you were overdue and failed to answer the radio.

The phone number fields should also be clickable in the phone apps, and clicking should bring up the phone's dialer to start a call to the other responder.</p>","created_at":"2017-06-24T02:30:34.960Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911FEAT-I-255","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911FEAT-I-255"},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3141","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3141","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":6,"score_facts":[],"tags":["User Metadata"],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369255087642633","name":"Fire vs. Medical Calls","reference_num":"PL-I-3052","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:33.282Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T16:08:05.186Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":7,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255724871442","name":"Already exists","complete":true},"description":{"id":"6400369255277555248","body":"Ability to choose dispatches of units based upon type of incident.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:33.327Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","admin_response":{"id":"6400726560737167812","body":"<p>Individual devices can use filtering to determine which groups of calls they would like. &nbsp;Documentation can be found on our wiki or support can help you get them set up.</p>","created_at":"2017-03-23T16:08:04.987Z","attachments":[],"responded_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"}},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3052","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3052","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369186612872254","name":"Reporting capabilities for Agency","reference_num":"PL-I-2933","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:17.338Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T21:47:41.746Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":7,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369186840195518","body":"You have a nice 30 day look at the calls in a pie chart and breaking them down by category.

That would help inform&nbsp;the priority of the following (and other similar&nbsp;ideas).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As&nbsp;for the improvements:</p>\r\n<p>1. We shouldn't assume address number 199 is directly in the center of 100 and 200... any algo for a 'weighted' midpoint will likely be more accurate.</p>\r\n<p>2. We should include the knowledge of even/odd addresses and pick two nearest on the same side of the street if possible (like what some other geocoding libraries currently do).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. The first point can also be applied to grid addresses w/ it's current implementation.</p>\r\n<p>4. There's another possible improvement for grid address interpolation, but I'm less confident in it so it would need to be tested to see if it actually improves accuracy: find smallest triangle (via 3 known points) which encompasses the unknown point using 2D distance formula (treating grid address numbers like psuedo units). And then find the weighted center (via similar method to 1 above).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And on a more general note... it would be nice if we broke wiz apart so it was more modular and we could potentially lean on some existing open source&nbsp;GIS libraries to handle these sorts of things outlined above (and other use cases we have talked about in the past, e.g. more robust parsing + normalization).&nbsp;</p>","created_at":"2017-08-15T17:57:31.462Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Not visible in

You can get it through apple or google you can do it but it doesnt show any of the map data that you entered. so what im really looking for is a navigation system like google or apple maps with the map data that you have entered into the map. my chief is looking to get tablets just for navigation but he has put it on standby now since there is no option for this !! please help !!!!</p>","created_at":"2017-05-02T06:52:59.340Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911FEAT-I-198","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911FEAT-I-198"},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3034","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3034","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":1,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369168885729975","name":"Navigate to map points","reference_num":"PL-I-2899","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:13.212Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T17:31:45.342Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":3,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369169009108468","body":"Ability to select a map point such as hydrant or LZ and get navigation to it.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:13.243Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-2899","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-2899","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369168416391000","name":"Test pages","reference_num":"PL-I-2898","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:13.099Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T17:35:07.803Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":3,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369168536380721","body":"Have an option to automatically send out a daily test page so it does not get forgotten","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:13.127Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-2898","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-2898","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369167074960486","name":"Allow iPad to lock when in Active911","reference_num":"PL-I-2895","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:01:12.789Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T15:07:01.366Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":3,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461256564594296","name":"Completed","complete":true},"description":{"id":"6400369167210193203","body":"**THIS IS INTENTIONAL.

Pre-planning is an essential part of an effective response to emergency incidents. Currently, our department uses MDC's in all of our apparatus, but would like to transition to iPads utilizing the Active911 app because of its versatility and cost effectiveness. One feature that makes us hesitant to make that transition is the ability to edit pre-plans in the field. The way Active911 is set up now, our staff has to create a pre-plan image on the desktop, upload those files from our desktop to the Active911 account, then look up the longitude and latitude to make sure we get it in the right location. When we need to edit pre-plan information, we have to do this process all over again. This lacks the portability/availability and time-saving features that Active911 is known for. Idea: - Create a pre-plan tab for the app, a database of searchable pre-plan data for that particular account. - Give specific devices the authority to edit pre-plan data. - Allow devices to drop a point on a map, and create a pre-plan for that location. - Allow devices to enter pre-plan information into a form. This would contain basic information such as utility locations, hazards, contact information, construction type, occupancy classification, number of stories, square footage/fire flow, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, etc. - Ability to view pre-plans directly from the call sheet based on the address of the emergency.

be nice to enhance the Map Data  features. Add ability to share/not share data points, so that not all data in the list is shared.  Just what we decide to share. Consider a way to identify Home Team data points vs data points from a neighbor.  Maybe a colored border around the icon or fade the icon color a bit.  Another option would be to show all mutual aid data points in grey vs colored for home agency. Develop a better way to share the data points without having to add a user from the other agency.

I think it would be better for it to continue to work for the duration of an incident.  For law enforcement, units conducting surveillance could maintain better situational awareness if they knew the location of every other unit on the detail.  Being able to see the locations of the other units on a map would be a great feature to have.  This would also apply to fire incidents.  For example, on a search and rescue incident in a forest, each member of the search team and the incident commander could see the position of each unit in real time.  Another potential benefit is one of enhanced responder safety.  Assume you run an EMS call in the winter, transport to nearest hospital, and then go available by radio, but then, on your way back to the station, you slide off the side of a mountain.  It would be nice if someone could find you once it was determined that you were overdue and failed to answer the radio.  Our units do not use AVL, so having this type of capability added to the app would be very useful.  There are likely other potential uses for GPS mapping for the duration of the incident, but these are just a couple that immediately come to mind.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:43.851Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","duplicate_of":{"id":"6362226147827219423","reference_num":"A911-I-19","name":"I want to always know where a device is","created_at":"2016-12-09T22:06:49.064Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461256564594296","name":"Completed","complete":true},"description":{"id":"6362226147968364074","body":"<p>Enable an Always on Device setting so they are always visible on the map</p>","created_at":"2016-12-09T22:06:49.102Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/A911-I-19","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/A911-I-19"},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3558","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3558","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369557385246204","name":"Hydrant Color Options","reference_num":"PL-I-3557","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:43.665Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T16:40:34.581Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":1,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461535923420757","name":"Started","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369557534395678","body":"Add the color black to the color options for hydrant's for if/when a hydrant becomes out of service for maintenance or is inoperable.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:43.701Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","duplicate_of":{"id":"6400369575544269239","reference_num":"PL-I-3587","name":"Black icon color for oos hydrants.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:47.894Z","workflow_status":{"id":"6367461535923420757","name":"Started","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369575713398392","body":"Would like to see the Color black for out of service hydrants ?????","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:47.931Z","attachments":[]},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3587","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3587"},"url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3557","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3557","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369554312234645","name":"Mass Email Attachments","reference_num":"PL-I-3552","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:42.951Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T19:40:47.068Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":1,"workflow_status":{"id":"6367461255111292127","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369554489477958","body":"Would be nice to be able to attach a file when sending a Mass Email to department members.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:42.991Z","attachments":[]},"visibility":"Visible to anyone","url":"https://active911.aha.io/ideas/ideas/PL-I-3552","resource":"https://active911.aha.io/api/v1/ideas/PL-I-3552","product":{"id":"6358524930568591543","reference_prefix":"A911FEAT","name":"Active911 For First Responders","product_line":false,"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:44:12.271Z"},"created_by_user":{"id":"6358521319733171320","name":"Bryan Walcott","email":"bryan.walcott@active911.com","created_at":"2016-11-29T22:30:11.558Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T03:28:52.777Z"},"assigned_to_user":null,"comments_count":0,"endorsements_count":0,"score_facts":[],"tags":[],"categories":[],"custom_fields":[]},{"id":"6400369548593148665","name":"Map Data - timer and ability to delete from iOS device","reference_num":"PL-I-3544","score":0,"created_at":"2017-03-22T17:02:41.621Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T18:28:48.698Z","product_id":"6358524930568591543","votes":1,"workflow_status":{"id":"6001166979457568121","name":"Needs review","complete":false},"description":{"id":"6400369548872530933","body":"Add an option to set a timer to a specific map icon.
